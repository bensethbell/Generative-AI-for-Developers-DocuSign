      "   - Leave partially covered at room temperature\n",
      "   - Feed daily with equal parts flour and water, discarding half first\n",
      "   - It takes 7-14 days until ready (bubbly, doubling, pleasant sour smell)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Gather essential equipment**:\n",
      "   - Digital kitchen scale (measuring by weight is crucial)\n",
      "   - Large mixing bowl\n",
      "   - Dough scraper\n",
      "   - Proofing basket or bowl with clean towel\n",
      "   - Dutch oven or baking stone (for steam during baking)\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Choose a simple beginner recipe** with:\n",
      "   - High bread flour content (easier to handle than all whole wheat)\n",
      "   - Moderate hydration (65-70% water to flour ratio)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Once your starter is ready:\n",
      "- Begin with a basic loaf to learn the feel of the dough\n",
      "- Focus on the process rather than perfection\n",

      "Making sourdough is a multi-day process, especially for beginners. Here's the typical timeline:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Creating Your Starter: 7-10 days\n",
      "- Day 1-7+: Daily feedings until starter consistently doubles\n",
      "- This is a one-time process - after this, you'll maintain your starter indefinitely\n",
      "\n",
      "## Baking a Loaf: 24-36 hours\n",
      "- **Active work time**: Only about 30-45 minutes total (spread across the process)\n",
      "- **Inactive time**: Most of the process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Day 1:\n",
      "- Feeding starter until active: 4-8 hours\n",
      "- Mixing dough: 5 minutes\n",
      "- Stretch and folds: 2-3 hours (just 1 minute of work every 30 minutes)\n",
      "- Bulk fermentation: 4-8 hours (hands-off)\n",
      "- Shaping: 5 minutes\n",
      "- Cold proof in refrigerator: 8-16 hours (overnight, hands-off)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Day 2:\n",
      "- Preheating oven: 45-60 minutes\n",
      "- Baking: 45-50 minutes\n",
      "- Cooling: 1-2 hours before slicing\n",
      "\n",
      "The good news is that while the timeline seems long, most of it is waiting while fermentation does its magic! The actual hands-on work is minimal.\n",
