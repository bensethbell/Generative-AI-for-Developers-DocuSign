    "| **Zero-Shot** | No examples provided | Simple tasks, quick queries |\n",

    "### Tips for Better Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Be specific** - Clearly state what you want\n",
    "2. **Use examples** - When zero-shot doesn't work well\n",
    "3. **Ask for reasoning** - Improves accuracy on complex tasks\n",
    "4. **Set temperature** - Use 0 for factual tasks, higher for creative tasks\n",
    "5. **Iterate** - Test and refine your prompts\n",
