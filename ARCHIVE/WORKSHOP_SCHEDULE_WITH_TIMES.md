# NOTES FOR INSTRUCTOR

## Day 1:
- **GitHub Copilot Lab** requires students to have Copilot access - confirm licensing beforehand
- Students should come with Python and API basics as prerequisites
- Afternoon labs can flex between OLD LAB 2 and NEW LABS depending on student needs

## Day 2:
- Morning "Context Engineering Practice" addresses part of the missing "Proposed Lab 1" but is not the full legacy code scenario described in outline
- RAG lab is the centerpiece - allocate full 2+ hours
- Responsible AI section is compressed (30 min for 5 major topics) - may need expansion

## Day 3:
- Completely different audience - more conceptual, less technical
- **Case study materials need to be created/sourced**
- Chatbot lab should be simplified version appropriate for less technical audience
- More discussion and group interaction expected

## Platform Considerations:
- Schedule uses OpenAI-based labs exclusively
- Outline mentions Gemini and Azure AI but no materials exist
- GitHub Copilot is standalone tool (not OpenAI API)
- Consider whether platform diversity is needed or OpenAI focus is acceptable
