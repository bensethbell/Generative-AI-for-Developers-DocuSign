Subject: Materials Review for Gen AI Workshop - Questions for Tomorrow's Call

Hi Hitesh,

I've been reviewing all the workshop materials in preparation for our call tomorrow, and I wanted to flag some discrepancies I found between the course outlines and the materials provided. I've created a detailed schedule document that maps everything out, but wanted to highlight the key questions upfront.

## Critical Gaps

**1. Missing Lab 1**
The Day 2 outline describes "Proposed Lab 1: Developer Productivity Accelerator with Context Engineering" (legacy code → explanation, tests, refactoring), but I don't see this lab in the materials. Should this be created, or is it being removed from the outline?

**2. Missing Slide Decks for Days 1-2**
I only found 2 slide decks for prompt engineering. The outline suggests there should be presentations for:
- LLM Fundamentals
- Core Concepts
- Context Engineering & API Parameter Tuning
- LLM Application Architecture & Implementation
- Responsible AI & Security

Are these slide decks available elsewhere, or should these sections be taught using only the PDFs?

**3. Day 3 Case Study Materials**
The Big Picture outline includes a "Case Studies and Discussion" section, but I don't see any case study materials. What should be used for this section?

## Platform & Tool Questions

**4. Platform Strategy**
The outlines mention Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI, but:
- The OLD LABS use Snowflake Cortex exclusively
- The NEW LABS I created use OpenAI API exclusively
- No Gemini or Azure examples exist

Is OpenAI the confirmed platform going forward? Should I add Gemini/Azure examples?

**5. GitHub Copilot Access**
Lab 1 requires GitHub Copilot. Will students have licenses, or should this be instructor-demo only?

**6. Missing Demos**
The OLD LABS include Snowflake demos for:
- Summarize functionality
- Sentiment Analysis

Should I create OpenAI equivalents of these, or are they being removed?

## Schedule & Content Questions

**7. Day 2 Afternoon Timing**
The Day 2 afternoon session seems packed:
- 60 min: Architecture
- 60 min: Implementation Deep Dive
- 90 min: RAG Lab
- 60 min: Responsible AI (covering 5 major topics: cost, reliability, bias, security, ethics)

That's 4.5 hours of content for a 4-hour session. Should anything be moved or condensed?

**8. Materials Alignment**
Can you confirm these mappings are correct?
- ✓ NEW LABS/RAG_with_OpenAI_Fixed.ipynb → Lab 2 (Knowledge-Base Chatbot)
- ✓ NEW LABS/Chatbot_with_OpenAI_Fixed.ipynb → Day 3 Hands-On Workshop
- ? NEW LABS/Prompt_Engineering_OpenAI.ipynb → Relates to structured outputs?
- ? NEW LABS/Zero_Shot_Few_Shot_Chain_of_Thought_OpenAI.ipynb → Not mentioned in outline, should it be integrated?

**9. EXTRA NOTES Usage**
Should the 5 EXTRA NOTES PDFs (AI Agents, Hallucination, Prompt Cheat-Sheet, MCP Server, RAG) be required reading for students, or are they just instructor reference materials?

## Document Reference

I've created a comprehensive schedule document (`WORKSHOP_SCHEDULE_AND_MATERIALS.md`) that maps all materials to the 3-day outline with detailed notes on every discrepancy. I'll have it ready to walk through on our call.

## Summary

The core content is solid - all 9 PDFs align well with the theory sections, and the RAG and Chatbot labs work great. The main issues are:
1. Missing Lab 1 entirely
2. Missing slide decks for Days 1-2
3. Platform inconsistencies (Snowflake → OpenAI, but outline mentions Gemini/Azure)
4. Some timing/pacing concerns

Looking forward to discussing these tomorrow and getting clarity on the path forward.

Best,
[Your Name]
