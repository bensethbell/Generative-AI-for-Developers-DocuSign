    "1. **Get an OpenAI API key:**\n",
    "   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/\n",
    "   - Sign up or log in\n",
    "   - Go to API Keys section\n",
    "   - Create a new API key\n",
    "   - Add $5-10 in credits to your account\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set your API key in Cell 1:**\n",
    "   - Replace `\"your-api-key-here\"` with your actual API key\n",
    "   - **OR** create a `.env` file with: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the cells in order!**\n",
