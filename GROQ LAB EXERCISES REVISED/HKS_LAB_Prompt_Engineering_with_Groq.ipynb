    "This lab focuses on demonstrating prompt engineering techniques using Groq. Prompt engineering is a critical aspect of utilizing Groq models effectively, as it involves crafting prompts that generate desired outputs. In this lab, we will cover various scenarios, including QnA, summarizing text, classifying text, generating new product names, translation, parsing unstructured data, and translating natural language queries into SQL queries."
