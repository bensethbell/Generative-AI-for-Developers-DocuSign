      "\n",
      "1. **Active Bubbles**: A healthy, active starter should be bubbly and frothy, with a noticeable increase in volume. You should see a lot of tiny bubbles forming on the surface and throughout the starter.\n",
      "2. **Double in Size**: A mature starter should roughly double in size within 4-6 hours after feeding. This indicates that the starter is healthy and has a good balance of yeast and bacteria.\n",
      "3. **Sourdough Smell**: A ripe starter should have a tangy, slightly sour aroma, often described as fruity, earthy, or even slightly vinegary.\n",
      "4. **Sticky, Thick Consistency**: A ready-to-use starter should be thick and sticky, similar to a thick pancake batter. It should still be pourable, but not too runny.\n",
      "5. **Fed and Waited**: Make sure you've fed your starter at least once before using it, and ideally, let it sit for a few hours after feeding to allow the microorganisms to activate and multiply.\n",

      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that every starter is different, and the exact timing may vary depending on factors like temperature, feeding frequency, and the type of flour used. If you're unsure, it's always better to err on the side of caution and wait a bit longer before using your starter.\n",
