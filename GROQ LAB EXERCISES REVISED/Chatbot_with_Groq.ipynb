      "Chatbot: Your sourdough starter is the heart of your bread-making process. It's ready to use when it has reached a state of maturity and stability, which usually takes around 7-14 days of regular feeding and care. Here are some signs to look out for to determine if your starter is ready to use:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Active Bubbles**: A healthy, active starter will have plenty of bubbles on its surface and throughout the mixture. This indicates that the wild yeast and bacteria are fermenting the sugars and producing carbon dioxide.\n",
      "2. **Doubled in Size**: A mature starter will roughly double in size within 4-6 hours after feeding. This is a sign that the microorganisms are actively consuming the sugars and producing CO2.\n",
      "3. **Tangy Aroma**: A sourdough starter will have a tangy, slightly sour smell, which is a result of the lactic acid produced by the bacteria.\n",
      "4. **Consistent Behavior**: A mature starter will have a consistent behavior, meaning it will respond predictably to feedings and environment changes. It will also have a consistent texture, which is usually thick and creamy, similar to pancake batter.\n",
      "5. **pH Level**: A mature starter will have a pH level between 3.5 and 4.5, which is slightly acidic.\n",
      "\n",
      "To test if your starter is ready to use, you can try the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Float Test**: Drop a small amount of starter into a glass of water. If it floats, it's ready to use. If it sinks, it needs more time to mature.\n",
      "* **Bread Test**: Mix a small amount of starter with flour and water to create a mini-dough. If it rises and has a nice texture, your starter is likely ready to use.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, every starter is unique, and the time it takes to mature can vary depending on factors like temperature, feeding schedule, and the type of flour used. Be patient, and with regular care and feeding, your starter will be ready to help you create delicious sourdough bread in no time!\n"

    "### Key Takeaways: Meta Prompting for Content Moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we learned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Meta prompting** uses the LLM to evaluate content before/after processing\n",
    "2. **Two-way moderation**: Check both user inputs AND bot responses\n",
    "3. **Use a faster model** (like `llama-3.1-8b-instant`) for moderation to reduce latency\n",
    "4. **Keep a log** of moderation decisions for debugging and auditing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Practice | Why |\n",
    "|----------|-----|\n",
    "| Define specific harmful content types | More accurate than generic \"harmful\" |\n",
    "| Use low temperature (0.1) for moderation | Consistent, predictable results |\n",
    "| Log all moderation decisions | Debugging and compliance |\n",
    "| Fail gracefully | Don't crash if moderation fails |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customization Ideas:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add domain-specific moderation rules (e.g., medical misinformation)\n",
    "- Implement severity levels (warn vs. block)\n",
    "- Add human review queue for borderline cases\n",
    "- Create allow-lists for specific terms that might be falsely flagged"
